<h5>Hi stranger, I’m Sebastian!</h5>
<h2>Welcome to this crazy little project! 👉 Rick and Morty Searcher 👈</h2>
<p>Here you can search and find some information about the show. A sidebar will be displayed if you click or tap the button in the upper-left corner, you can activate one of the three filters provided, which will allow you to search by character name, location, or episode. All the relevant information can be obtained by entering the name in the input field depending on the active filter.</p>

<h4>You can even play with it</h4>
<p>This project was deployed in gh-pages 🙌. <a href="https://seba-toso.github.io/rickandmorty-app/" title="https://seba-toso.github.io/rickandmorty-app/">Here</a></p>

<h2>WOW, I made it!🤯 But, how does this thing WORK</h2>
<p>The web app has a home screen and an "about" page. <br>
<br>
<strong>Home Screen</strong><br>
In the upper-left corner there is a button that prompts a sidebar. You may apply a filter from this sidebar for your searches and then go to the "about" page.<br>
An input field allows you to enter the name of the character(s), episode(s) or dimension(s) that you wish to find. Next to this field, there is a "start search" button and a "clear all" button that will revert everything back to square one.<br>
After a search is made, the results are shown in a box below the input field and they are displayed in cards. Those cards are clickables and will show you more detailed information!.<br>
And that's it.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p><strong>Live long and prosper</strong> 🖖</p>
